# Buncha Prometheus YAML

This is the Ansible role I use to do things with Prometheus. It is super opinionated to the point where it may or may not be usable to those who do not live inside my head except as a reference.

It supports the following contexts

* Prometheus itself
* Prometheus Collectd exporter
* Prometheus SNMP exporter
* CAdvisor
* Prometheus CloudWatch Exporter
* Prometheus Blackbox Exporter
